**Introduction:**
Steganography is the practice of hiding secret information within a non-secret file or message to avoid detection. This project demonstrates the implementation of steganography techniques to conceal data within image files. The aim is to provide a simple yet effective tool to understand and explore the concepts of data hiding.

**Features:**
Hide text messages within image files.
Extract hidden messages from steganographic images.
Support for various image formats (e.g., PNG, JPEG).
Command-line interface for easy interaction.
Error detection to ensure message integrity.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pillow (PIL) - Python Imaging Library
NumPy
